To simulate a network connection between two Ubuntu VMs using MATLAB's satellite communication model, you'll need to break the problem down into several components:

1. **Create a communication link between the two VMs**

   * Use networking features like TCP/IP or UDP to establish communication between the two VMs.
2. **Simulate Satellite Link with MATLAB**:

   * You can use MATLAB's Satellite Communications Toolbox to simulate satellite links, including effects like signal propagation, noise, and delay.
3. **Connect the Networking Model to the Satellite Communication**:

   * Implement the satellite model in MATLAB that simulates the physical layer of satellite communication (propagation delay, link budget, modulation, etc.), and route the data through this satellite communication system.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

---

### 1. **Setting Up the VMs for Networking**

1. **Network Configuration on Ubuntu VMs**:

   * First, make sure both Ubuntu VMs are on the same network or bridged to a common network.
   * If you're using VirtualBox or VMware, configure both VMs to use **bridged networking** or **host-only networking** so they can communicate with each other.

2. **Test Connectivity**:

   * Use `ping` or `ssh` to ensure the two VMs can communicate:

     ```bash
     ping <IP_of_other_VM>
     ```

### 2. **Creating a Basic Communication Link (TCP/UDP) in MATLAB**

On both VMs, you'll need to use MATLAB to establish a basic communication link between the two machines.

#### Sender (VM 1):

```matlab
% VM1 - Sender
host = 'receiver_ip'; % IP address of VM2
port = 5000; % Example port number

% Create TCP/IP object
t = tcpip(host, port, 'NetworkRole', 'Client');

% Open connection
fopen(t);

% Send a message
fprintf(t, 'Hello from VM1 to VM2 over Satellite Link!');

% Close connection
fclose(t);
delete(t);
```

#### Receiver (VM 2):

```matlab
% VM2 - Receiver
port = 5000; % Same port number as in sender

% Create TCP/IP object
t = tcpip('0.0.0.0', port, 'NetworkRole', 'Server');

% Open connection
fopen(t);

% Read the incoming message
received_data = fread(t, t.BytesAvailable);
disp(['Received Data: ', char(received_data')]);

% Close connection
fclose(t);
delete(t);
```

### 3. **Simulate Satellite Communication in MATLAB**

To simulate the satellite communication, you'll use the MATLAB Satellite Communications Toolbox.

1. **Model Propagation Delay**:
   Use the `satelliteLink` model from MATLAB to simulate the communication link's delay and signal propagation.

#### Satellite Communication Model Example:

```matlab
% Set up the satellite parameters
earth_radius = 6371; % in km
satellite_altitude = 35786; % Geostationary orbit, in km
distance = earth_radius + satellite_altitude; % Distance from Earth to satellite in km

% Set up transmission parameters
transmit_power = 100; % in watts
frequency = 12e9; % Frequency in Hz (Ka-band)

% Satellite Link Simulation (Signal Propagation)
link_delay = (distance / 3e8); % Propagation delay in seconds (speed of light)
disp(['Propagation delay: ', num2str(link_delay), ' seconds']);

% Modeling signal attenuation and link budget
free_space_loss = (4 * pi * distance * frequency / 3e8)^2;
disp(['Free-space path loss: ', num2str(free_space_loss)]);
```

2. **Add Delay and Attenuation**:
   You can now introduce this delay into your network communication model. For example, you can simulate the latency by adding a `pause()` in the sender code, and use `free_space_loss` for attenuation.

### 4. **Combine Networking and Satellite Communication**

Now, integrate the networking (TCP/IP communication) with the satellite communication model. You can modify your sender to include the propagation delay and simulate signal attenuation as part of the data transmission process.

#### Sender (VM 1) with Delay:

```matlab
% VM1 - Sender with Satellite Delay
host = 'receiver_ip';
port = 5000;

% Satellite parameters
distance = 35786 + 6371; % distance in km
link_delay = (distance / 3e8); % in seconds

% Create TCP/IP object
t = tcpip(host, port, 'NetworkRole', 'Client');
fopen(t);

% Introduce delay due to satellite communication
pause(link_delay);

% Send message
fprintf(t, 'Message sent over satellite link with delay!');

% Close connection
fclose(t);
delete(t);
```

#### Receiver (VM 2) with Signal Loss:

```matlab
% VM2 - Receiver with Signal Loss
port = 5000;

% Satellite link attenuation
free_space_loss = (4 * pi * distance * 12e9 / 3e8)^2;

% Create TCP/IP object
t = tcpip('0.0.0.0', port, 'NetworkRole', 'Server');
fopen(t);

% Read the incoming message
received_data = fread(t, t.BytesAvailable);

% Simulate attenuation (simple example of data loss)
if rand() < free_space_loss
    disp('Signal lost due to high attenuation!');
else
    disp(['Received Data: ', char(received_data')]);
end

% Close connection
fclose(t);
delete(t);
```

### 5. **Optimizing the Link**

To improve or optimize the satellite communication link, you can simulate various parameters:

* **Error correction**: Use coding techniques like convolutional codes or Turbo codes to handle signal degradation.
* **Modulation schemes**: Implement modulation schemes (e.g., QPSK, 16-QAM) to model real satellite communication systems.
* **Interference & Noise**: Add noise to simulate real-world channel conditions.

### Final Steps

* **Testing**: Run this setup in a controlled environment where you can monitor the communication between the two VMs and simulate the satellite linkâ€™s performance.
* **Extend the Model**: Add more detailed satellite propagation models, multiple hops, or even simulate multiple VMs communicating over the satellite network.

Would you like to explore any of these steps in more detail, or do you have specific requirements for the simulation?
